# Kruskal_Algorithm_Simulator

Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm Simulator is a GUI tool designed to simulate and visualize Kruskalâ€™s Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm using established libraries for graph representation and manipulation. It allows users to interactively create graphs, run the algorithm step-by-step, and observe the formation of a minimum spanning tree or forest in real-time.

ðŸš€ Getting Started

Compile the Java Files: Start by compiling the provided Java files. These include:

- `GraphComp`: This is the parent class of all graph components.
- `GraphNode`: Represents a node in a graph.
- `GraphEdge`: Represents an edge in a graph.
- `Graph310`: Implementtation of Graph<GraphNode,GraphEdge> and UndirectedGraph<GraphNode,GraphEdge>.
- `WeissBST`: Implementation of Binary Search Tree code to support the project.
- `Set310`: An implementation of a Set class using WeissBST.
- `Map310`: An implementation of a Map class.
- `ThreeTenAlg`: Defines an algorithm that can be simulated with the GUI.
- `Kruskal310`: Handles all the options of the simulator.
- `SimGUI`: Handles all the graphical elements of the simulator.

Run the Example: Once you've compiled the Java files, run the provided `SimGUI.java` file. This file contains a small example that demonstrates how to use the classes implemented in this project.
